========================  Generate ARS ==========================
1. NE Type
2. NE release
3. Last NE release
4. Older NE releases

=========================== To be done =========================
General:
1. The value of some excel cell should be calculated by formula, same as ARS template

Object Model:
1. Set alarming object flag for exiting PM object in object model
2. Add FM only object in object model
3. Set CM object flag for existing PM object in object model
4. Mark object which has icon
5. Mark object which has GUI launch
6. Add 3GPP NBI mapping strategy
7. Set integration version for agent object
8. Mark agent object and interface object
9. Add interface objects in object model

PM Data Load:
1. Set time aggregation rule for certain measurement
2. Set BH for certain measurement
3. Mark if measurement is active or not
4. Set default/minimal interval for certain measurement
5. Global config: storage days
6. Global config: default bytes for one counter
7. Set measurement group
8. Set number of PM files per interval

============================ Issues ===============================
1. One blank line is added between two adaptations' topology in object model
